# Guidelines for QuartoAI

### Board Game Design
* 4x4 board game. 16 pieces.
* Each piece will have 4 boolean atrributes:
  1. hasAttribute1 (like color, white or black)
  2. hasAttribute2 (like height, tall or short)
  3. hasAttribute3 (like shape, circle or square)
  4. hasAttribute4 (like hollow or not hollow)
* Winner is determined by having 4 of the same attributes in a row.

### Game Development
* We'll start off with **iOS** for prototype and then convert code to **Java** to put it on website.
* Start learning Java and its library Swing, we'll be using that to build the Quarto.


### Using GitHub
  1. Copy the project: `git clone https://github.com/logicxd/QuartoAI.git`
  2. Make your own branch: `git checkout -b <MY_BRANCH_NAME>`
  3. Make any changes to your branch: `git add .`, `git commit -m "Put why you are committing here"`, `git pull`, `git push`. (Make sure you're not changing the master branch, check with `git branch`)
  4. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/logicxd/QuartoAI/pulls) if you want to merge into master.

Typical

1) pull from master. git pull
2) make a separate branch of master: git checkout -b <myBranch>
3) make w.e changes in <myBranch>, then add, commit, push
4) make a pull request to merge your branch and master
