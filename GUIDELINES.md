# Guidelines for QuartoAI

### Board Game Design
* 4x4 board game. 16 pieces.
* Each piece will have 4 boolean atrributes:
  1. hasAttribute1 (like color, white or black)
  2. hasAttribute2 (like height, tall or short)
  3. hasAttribute3 (like shape, circle or square)
  4. hasAttribute4 (like hollow or not hollow)
* Winner is determined by having 4 of the same attributes in a row.

### Game Development
* We'll start off with **iOS** for prototype and then convert code to **Java** to put it on website.
* Start learning Java and its library Swing, we'll be using that to build the Quarto.
